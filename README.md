# Google Analytics Customer Revenue Prediction
## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the total revenue generated by each customer of the Google Merchandise Store (also known as GStore) based on historical visit data. Using data from Google Analytics, I'm building a model to forecast how much each customer is likely to spend, which can help businesses make better marketing and operational decisions.

## Motivation
In many businesses, a small percentage of customers contribute to most of the revenue (often referred to as the 80/20 rule). Identifying and predicting these high-value customers allows companies to optimize marketing efforts and improve overall efficiency. This project demonstrates how thorough data analysis and predictive modeling can be applied to real-world e-commerce data, with a focus on maximizing revenue insights.
