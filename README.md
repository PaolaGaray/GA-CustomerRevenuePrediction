# Google Analytics Customer Revenue Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the total revenue generated by each customer of the Google Merchandise Store (also known as GStore) based on historical visit data. Using data from Google Analytics, I'm building a model to forecast how much each customer is likely to spend, which can help businesses make better marketing and operational decisions.

## Motivation

In many businesses, a small percentage of customers contribute to most of the revenue (often referred to as the 80/20 rule). Identifying and predicting these high-value customers allows companies to optimize marketing efforts and improve overall efficiency. This project demonstrates how thorough data analysis and predictive modelling can be applied to real-world e-commerce data, with a focus on maximizing revenue insights.

## Data Description

The dataset consists of customer visit data for the Google Merchandise Store, provided by Google and available on Kaggle. Each row in the dataset represents a visit to the store, containing information about:

- Visitor Information (`fullVisitorId`): A unique identifier for each user.
- Visit Details (`visitId`, `visitStartTime`): Details about individual sessions.
- Traffic Source (`trafficSource`, `channelGrouping`): Information about how the user arrived at the store.
- Device and Location (`device`, `geoNetwork`): Specifications about the user’s device and location.
- Session Aggregates (`totals`): Aggregated data per session, including metrics like page views and transaction revenue.

The target variable for prediction is the **total revenue per user** (summed across all sessions), transformed as `ln(y_user + 1)` to account for skewed revenue distribution. This transformation allows the model to learn effectively across a range of user spending patterns.
